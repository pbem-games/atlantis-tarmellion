    Tarmellion is an open-ended computer moderated fantasy game for any
    number of players. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires,
    become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any other
    career that comes to mind. There is no declared winner of the game;
    players set their own objectives, and one can join at any time.

      Playing Atlantis
    </H2>
    <P>
      Atlantis (as you undoubtedly already know) is a play by email game. 
      When you sign up for Atlantis, you will be sent a turn report (via
      email).  Your report completely details your position in the game. 
      After going over this report, and possibly communicating with other
      players in the game, you determine your course of action, and create a
      file of "orders", which you then send back to the Atlantis server. Then,
      at a regular interval (often one week), Atlantis collects all the
      orders, runs another turn (covering one month in game time), and sends
      all the players another report.
    </P>
    <A NAME="playing_factions"></A>
    <H3>
      Factions:
    </H3>
    <P>
      A player's position is called a "faction".  Each faction has a name and
      a number (the number is assigned by the computer, and used for entering
      orders). Each player is allowed to play one and ONLY one faction at any
      given time. Each faction is composed of a number of "units", each unit
      being a group of one or more people loyal to the faction.  You start the
      game with a single unit consisting of one character, plus a sum of
      money.  More people can be hired during the course of the game, and
      formed into more units.  (In these rules, the word "character" generally
      refers either to a unit consisting of only one person, or to a person
      within a larger unit.)
    </P>
    <P>
      A faction is considered destroyed, and the player knocked out of the
      game, if ever all its people are killed or disbanded (i.e. the faction
      has no units left).  The program does not consider your starting
      character to be special; if your starting character gets killed, you
      will probably have been thinking of that character as the leader of your
      faction, so some other character can be regarded as having taken the
      dead leader's place (assuming of course that you have at least one
      surviving unit!).  As far as the computer is concerned, as long as any
      unit of the faction survives, the faction is not wiped out.  (If your
      faction is wiped out, you can rejoin the game with a new starting
      character.)
    </P>
    <P>
      In Tarmellion the starting character is a little different from all the
      others that can be hired. It is a true hero and will already know a
      range of skills that are determined by the profession chosen by you at
      game start. He also has quite a lot more possibilities of studying than
      all the others. If this character is killed, you will not drop out of
      the game, but will suffer a severe setback. So kepp him safe!

      Each faction has a type; this is decided by the player, and determines
      what the faction may do.  The faction has 5 Faction Points, which may be
      spent on any of the 3 Faction Areas, War, Trade, and Magic.  The faction
      type may be changed at the beginning of each turn, so a faction can
      change and adapt to the conditions around it.  Faction Points spent on
      War determine the number of regions in which factions can obtain income
      by taxing or pillaging. Faction Points spent on Trade determine the
      number of regions in which a faction may conduct trade activity. Trade
      activity includes producing goods, building ships and buildings, and
      buying trade items. Faction Points spent on Magic determines the number
      of mages the faction may have. (More information on all of the faction
      activities is in further sections of the rules).  Here is a chart
      detailing the limits on factions by Faction Points.

      For example, a well rounded faction might spend 2 points on War, 1 point
      on Trade, and 2 points on Magic.  This faction's type would appear as
      "War 2 Trade 1 Magic 2", and would be able to tax 24 regions, perform
      trade in 12 regions, and have 14 mages.
    </P>
    <P>
      As another example, a specialized faction might spend all 5 points on
      War. This faction's type would appear as "War 5", and it would be able
      to tax 100 regions, but could not perform trade in any regions, and
      could not possess any mages.
    </P>
    <P>
      Note that it is possible to have a faction type with less than 5 points
      spent. In fact, a starting faction has one point spent on each of War,
      Trade, and Magic, leaving 2 points unspent.
    </P>
    <P>
      When a faction starts the game, it is given a one-man unit and 5020
      silver in unclaimed money.  Unclaimed money is cash that your whole
      faction has access to, but cannot be taken away in battle (silver in a
      unit's possessions can be taken in battle).  This allows a faction to
      get started without presenting an enticing target for other factions.
      Units in your faction may use the <A HREF="#claim">CLAIM</A> order to
      take this silver, and use it to buy goods or recruit men, or use the <A
      HREF="#withdraw">WITHDRAW</A> order to withdraw goods directly.
    </P>
    <P>
      In Tarmellion I can only encourage you to balance your faction points. A
      specialized faction might have fun playing this game but I doubt it. I
      advice that you have at least two Faction Areas. The three Faction Areas
      are very closely linked and doing without one or even two should be well
      thought about. Naturally you may decide otherwise and spend you faction
      points however you like.
    </P>
    <P>
      An example faction is shown below, consisting of a starting character,
      Merlin the Magician, who has formed two more units, Merlin's Guards and
      Merlin's Workers. Each unit is assigned a unit number by the computer
      (completely independent of the faction number); this is used for
      entering orders. Here, the player has chosen to give his faction the
      same name ("Merlin the Magician") as his starting character.
      Alternatively, you can call your faction something like "The Great
      Northern Mining Company" or whatever.

    <H3>
      Units:
    </H3>
    <P>
      A unit is a grouping together of people, all loyal to the same faction.
      The people in a unit share skills and possessions, and execute the same
      orders each month. The reason for having units of many people, rather
      than keeping track of individuals, is to simplify the game play.  The
      computer does not keep track of individual names, possessions, or skills
      for people in the same unit, and all the people in a particular unit
      must be in the same place at all times.  If you want to send people in
      the same unit to different places, you must split up the unit.  Apart
      from this, there is no difference between having one unit of 50 people,
      or 50 units of one person each, except that the former is very much
      easier to handle.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are different races that make up the population of Atlantis. (See
      the section on skills for a list of these.) In addition there are some
      special persons in some races that almost make up a new race. They have
      the possibility to gain higher skills and to learn more than one skill.
      (You should also see the section on skills about them.) Units made up of
      normal people may only know one skill, and cannot teach other units. 
      Units made up of leaders or special persons or racesmay know as many
      skills as desired, and may teach other units to speed the learning
      process. Leaders and normal people may not be mixed in the same unit.
      However, leaders are more expensive to recruit and maintain. (More
      information is in the section on skills.) A unit is treated as the least
      common denominator of the people within it, so a unit made up of two
      races with different strengths and weaknesses will have all the
      weaknesses, and none of the strengths of either race.

    <A NAME="playing_turns"></A>
    <H3>
      Turns:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Each turn, the Atlantis server takes the orders file that you mailed to
      it, and assigns the orders to the respective units. All units in your
      faction are completely loyal to you, and will execute the orders to the
      best of their ability. If the unit does something unintended, it is
      generally because of incorrect orders; a unit will not purposefully
      betray you.
    </P>
    <P>
      A turn is equal to one game month.  A unit can do many actions at the
      start of the month, that only take a matter of hours, such as buying and
      selling commodities, or fighting an opposing faction.  Each unit can
      also do exactly one action that takes up the entire month, such as
      harvesting resources or moving from one region to another.  The orders
      which take an entire month are <A HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A>, <A

      The Atlantis world is divided for game purposes into hexagonal regions. 
      Each region has a name, and one of the following terrain types:  Ocean,
      Plain, Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Jungle, Desert, or Tundra. (There are
      other types of terrain to be discovered as the game progresses. Some of
      them may be encountered while reading these rules.)  Regions can contain
      units belonging to players; they can also contain structures such as
      buildings and ships. Two units in the same region can normally interact,
      unless one of them is concealed in some way.  Two units in different
      regions cannot normally interact.  NOTE: Combat is an exception to this.

      This report gives all of the available information on this region.  The
      region type is plain, the name of the surrounding area is Turia, and the
      coordinates of this region are (172,110).  The population of this region
      is 500 nomads, and there is $2500 of taxable income currently in this
      region.  Then, under the dashed line, are various details about items
      for sale, wages, etc.  Finally, there is a list of all visible units. 
      Units that belong to your faction will be so denoted by a '*', whereas

      Most regions are similar to the region shown above, but the are certain

      The structure lists the name, the number, and what type of structure it
      is.  (More information of the types of structures can be found in the

      Units inside structures are still considered to be in the region, and
      other units can interact with them; however, they may gain benefits,
      such as defensive bonuses in combat from being inside a building.  The
      first unit to enter an object is considered to be the owner; only this
      unit can do things such as renaming the object, or permitting other
      units to enter. The owner of an object can be identified on the turn
      report, as it is the first unit listed under the object.  Only units
      with men in them can be structure owners, so newly created units cannot
      own a structure until they contain men.

      In Tarmellion each player starts in one of the large cities of the

      Movement

      There are two main methods of movement in Atlantis.  The first is done
      using the <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order (or the <A
      HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> order), and moves units individually from
      one region to another. The other method is done using the <A
      HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order, which can sail a ship, including all of its
      occupants from one region to another. Certain powerful mages may also
      teleport themselves, or even other units, but the knowledge of the
      workings of this magic is carefully guarded.

    <A NAME="movement_normal"></A>
    <H3>
      Normal Movement:
    </H3>
    <P>
      In one month, a unit can issue a single <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order,
      using one or more of its movement points. There are three modes of
      travel: walking, riding and flying. Walking units have two movement
      points, riding units have four, and flying units have six. A unit will
      automatically use the fastest mode of travel it has available. The <A
      HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> order is the same as <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A>, except that it implies attacks on units which try
      to forbid access; see the section on combat for details.
    </P>
    <P>
      Flying units are not initially available to starting players. A unit can
      ride provided that the carrying capacity of its horses is at least as
      great as the weight of its people and all other items.  A unit can walk
      provided that the carrying capacity of its people, mounts, and wagons is
      at least as great as the weight of all its other items, and provided
      that it has at least as many horses as wagons (otherwise the excess
      wagons count as weight, not capacity). Otherwise the unit cannot issue a
      <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order. Most people weigh 10 units and have a
      capacity of 5 units; data for items is as follows:

      A unit which can fly, is capable of travelling over water. However, if
      the unit ends its turn over a water hex that unit will drown.
    </P>
    <P>
      Since regions are hexagonal, each region has six neighbouring regions to
      the north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest and northwest.  Moving
      from one region to another normally takes one movement point, except
      that the following terrain types take two movement points for riding or
      walking units to enter: Forest, Mountain, Hill, Jungle, Swamp, Tundra,
      Mystforest, Underforest, Grotto, Deepforest and Tunnel Also, during
      certain seasons (depending on the latitude of the region), all units
      (including flying ones) have a harder time and travel will take twice as
      many movement points as normal, as freezing weather makes travel
      difficult; in the tropics, seasonal hurricane winds and torrential rains
      have a similar effect. Some Lake, Swamp or Tunnel regions may have
      differing movement costs, because they are more or less difficult to
      cross. Units may not move through ocean regions without using the <A
      HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order unless they are capable of flight, and even
      then, flying units must end their movement on land or else drown.
    </P>
    <P>
      Units may also enter or exit structures while moving.  Moving into or
      out of a structure does not use any movement points at all.  Note that a
      unit can also use the <A HREF="#enter">ENTER</A> and <A
      HREF="#leave">LEAVE</A> orders to move in and out of structures, without
      issuing a <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order. The unit can also use the <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order to enter or leave a structure.
    </P>
    <P>
      Finally, certain structures contain interior passages to other regions. 
      The <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> IN order can be used to go through these
      passages; the movement point cost is equal to the normal cost to enter
      the destination region.
    </P>
    <P>
      Example: One man with a horse, sword, and chain mail wants to move
      north, then northeast.  The capacity of the horse is 20 and the weight
      of the man and other items is 12, so he can ride. The month is April, so
      he has four movement points. He issues the order MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST.
      First he moves north, into a plain region.  This uses one movement
      point. Then he moves northeast, into a forest region. This uses two
      movement points, so the movement is completed with one to spare.
    </P>
    <A NAME="movement_sailing"></A>

      Sailing:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Movement by sea is in some ways similar. It does not use the <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order however.  Instead, the owner of a ship must
      issue the <A HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order, and other units wishing to
      help sail the ship must also issue the <A HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order.
      The ship will then, if possible, make the indicated movement, carrying
      all units on the ship with it.  Units on board the ship, but not aiding
      in the sailing of the ship, may execute other orders while the ship is
      sailing.  A unit which does not wish to travel with the ship should
      leave the ship in a coastal region, before the <A HREF="#sail">SAIL</A>
      order is processed.  (A coastal region is defined as a non-ocean region
      with at least one adjacent ocean region.)
    </P>
    <P>
      Note that a unit on board a ship while it is sailing may not <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A> later in the turn, even if he doesn't issue the <A
      HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order; sailing is considered to take the whole
      month. Also, units may not remain on guard while on board a sailing
      ship; they will have to reissue the <A HREF="#guard">GUARD</A> 1 order
      to guard a region after sailing.
    </P>
    <P>
      Ships get four movement points per turn.  A ship can move from an ocean
      region to another ocean region, or from a coastal region to an ocean
      region, or from an ocean region to a coastal region. Ships can only be
      constructed in coastal regions. For a ship to enter any region only
      costs one movement point; the cost of two movement points for entering,
      say, a forest coastal region, does not apply. Ships do, however, only
      get half movement points during the winter months (or monsoon months in
      the tropical latitudes).
    </P>
    <P>
      A ship can only move if the total weight of everything aboard does not
      exceed the ship's capacity.  (The rules do not prevent an overloaded
      ship from staying afloat, only from moving.)  Also, there must be enough
      sailors aboard (using the <A HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order), to sail the
      ship, or it will not go anywhere.  Note that the sailing skill increases
      the usefulness of a unit proportionally; thus, a 1 man unit with level 5
      sailing skill can sail a longboat alone.  (See the section on skills for
      further details on skills.)  The capacities (and costs in labor units)
      of the various basic ship types are as follows:

      Normal movement in Atlantis, meaning <A HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> and
      <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> orders, is processed one hex of movement at a
      time, region by region. So, Atlantis cycles through all of the regions;
      for each region, it finds any units that wish to move, and moves them
      (if they can move) one hex (and only one hex). After processing one such
      region, it initiates any battles that take place due to these movements,
      and then moves on to the next region. After it has gone through all of
      the regions, you will note that units have only moved one hex, so it
      goes back and does the whole process again, except this time moving
      units their second hex (if they have enough movement points left). This
      continues until no units can move anymore.
    </P>
    <P>
      Sailing is handled differently; Atlantis cycles through all of the ships
      in Atlantis, moving them one at a time. When Atlantis sails a ship, it
      sails it through its entire course, either to the end, or until the ship
      enters a hex guarded against some unit on the ship, and then moves onto
      the next ship.
    </P>
    <P>
      Note that in either case, the order in which the regions are processed
      is undefined by the rules. The computer generally does them in the same
      order every time, but it is up to the wiles of the player to determine
      (or not) these patterns. The order in which units or ships are moved
      within a region is the order that they appear on a turn report.

    <P>
      The most important thing distinguishing one character from another in
      Atlantis is skills.  The following skills are available: mining,
      lumberjack, quarrying, hunting, fishing, herb lore, smithing, carpenter,
      building, shipbuilding, entertainment, tactics, combat, riding,
      crossbow, longbow, stealth, observation, healing, sailing, farming,
      ranching, animal training, and cooking. When a unit possesses a skill,
      he also has a skill level to go with it.  Generally, the effectiveness
      of a skill is directly proportional to the skill level involved, so a
      unit with level 2 in a skill is twice as good as a unit with level 1 in
      the same skill.

    <P>
      A unit made up of leaders may know one or more skills. In Tarmellion
      there are some races or special persons of a given race who can know
      more than one skill. Either their name contains the word leader or at
      least their abreviation starts with an L.; For the rest of this section,
      the word "leader" will refer to such a unit.  Other units, those which
      contain non-leaders, will be refered to as normal units. A normal unit
      may only know one skill.
    </P>
    <P>
      Skills may be learned up to a maximum level depending on the race of the
      studying unit (remembering that for units containing more than one race,
      the maximum is determined by the least common denominator).  Every race
      has a normal maximum skill level, and  a list of skills that they
      specialize in, and can learn up to higher level. Leaders, being more
      powerful, can learn skills to even higher levels. Here is a list of the
      races (including leaders) and the information on normal skill levels and
      specialized skills.

    <P>
      If units are merged together, their skills are averaged out. No rounding
      off is done; rather, the computer keeps track for each unit of how many
      total months of training that unit has in each skill. When units are
      split up, these months are divided as evenly as possible among the
      people in the unit; but no months are ever lost.
    </P>
    <A NAME="skills_studying"></A>
    <H3>
      Studying:
    </H3>
    <P>
      For a unit to gain level 1 of a skill, they must gain one months worth
      of training in that skill.  To raise this skill level to 2, the unit
      must add an additional two months worth of training.  Then, to raise
      this to skill level 3 requires another three months worth of training,
      and so forth.  A month of training is gained when a unit uses the <A
      HREF="#study">STUDY</A> order.  Note that study months do not need to be
      consecutive; for a unit to go from level 1 to level 2, he can study for
      a month, do something else for a month, and then go back and complete
      his second month of study.  A unit can also increase its level of
      training by using a skill.  This progress is much slower than studying. 
      Only one skill can be improved through practice in any month; if
      multiple skills are used, only the first will be improved.  A skill will
      only improve with practice if the unit has first studied the rudiments
      of the skill.
    </P>
    <P>
      The basic skills (like combat or farming) cost $10 per person per month
      to study (in addition to normal maintenance costs).
    </P>
    <P>
      Skills that produce things out of ressources (like smithing or building)
      cost $20.
    </P>
    <P>
      The exceptions are Stealth and Observation (both of which cost $50),
      Animaltaming and Monstertaming (which cost $50), Weaponcraft and
      Armorcraft (which cost $50), Magic skills (which cost $200), and Tactics
      (which costs $200).
    </P>
    <P>
      But the study costs for each skill are given in the skill report after
      first studying. So if you have trouble remembering the exact cost of a
      given skill, remember that there is no skill more expensive than $200.
    </P>
    <A NAME="skills_teaching"></A>
    <H3>
      Teaching:
    </H3>
    <P>
      A unit with a teacher can learn up to twice as fast as normal. The <A
      HREF="#teach">TEACH</A> order is used to spend the month teaching one or
      more other units (your own or another factions).  The unit doing the
      teaching must have a skill level greater than the unit doing the
      studying.  (Note: for all skill uses, it is skill level, not number of
      months of training, that counts. Thus, a unit with 1 month of training
      is effectively the same as a unit with 2 months of training, since both
      have a skill level of 1.)  The units being taught simply issue the <A
      HREF="#study">STUDY</A> order normally (also, his faction must be
      declared Friendly by the teaching faction).  Each person can only teach
      up to 10 students in a month; additional students dilute the training. 
      Thus, if 1 teacher teaches 20 men, each man being taught will gain 1 1/2
      months of training, not 2 months.
    </P>
    <P>
      Note that it is quite possible for a single unit to teach two or more
      other units different skills in the same month, provided that the
      teacher has a higher skill level than each student in the skill that
      that student is studying, and that there are no more than 10 students
      per teacher.

      Skill Reports:
    </H3>
    <P>
      When a faction learns a new skill level for this first time, it will be
      given a report on special abilities that a unit with this skill level
      has. This report can be shown again at any time (once a faction knows
      the skill), using the <A HREF="#show">SHOW</A> order. For example, when
      a faction learned the skill Shoemaking level 3 for the first time, it
      might receive the following (obviously farsical) report:
    </P>

Shoemaking [SHOE] 3: A unit with this skill may PRODUCE Sooper Dooper

      The Economy
    </H2>
    <P>
      The unit of currency in Atlantis is the silver piece. Silver is a normal
      item, with zero weight, appearing in your unit's reports. Silver is used
      for such things as buying items, and unit's maintenance.
    </P>
    <A NAME="economy_maintenance"></A>
    <H3>
      Maintenance Costs:
    </H3>
    <P>
      IMPORTANT:  Each and every character in Atlantis requires a maintenance
      fee each month. Anyone who ends the month without this maintenance cost
      has a 33 percent chance of starving to death. It is up to you to make
      sure that your people have enough money available. Money will be shared
      automatically between your units in the same region, if one is starving
      and another has more than enough; but this will not happen between units
      in different regions (this sharing of money applies only for maintenance
      costs, and does not occur for other purposes). If you have silver in
      your unclaimed fund, then that silver will be automatically claimed by
      units that would otherwise starve. Lastly, if a faction is allied to
      yours, their units will provide surplus cash to your units for
      maintenance, as a last resort.
    </P>
    <P>
      This fee is generally 10 silver for a normal character, and 20 silver
      for a leader. Units may substitute one unit of rations, food,
      delicatessen, meat, mushroom, grain, small livestock, small lizards,
      livestock, lizards, or fish for each 10 silver of maintenance owed. A
      unit may use the <A HREF="#consume">CONSUME</A> order to specify that it
      wishes to use food items in preference to silver.  Note that these items
      may be worth more when sold in towns, so selling them and using the
      money might be more economical than using them for maintenance. As
      multiple items of rations and food can be made out of the other types of
      edibles, it makes sense to rely on these others only in emergencies.

      Recruiting:
    </H3>
    <P>
      People may be recruited in a region.  The total amount of recruits
      available per month in a region, and the amount that must be paid per
      person recruited, are shown in the region description. The <A
      HREF="#buy">BUY</A> order is used to recruit new people. New recruits
      will not have any skills or items.  Note that the process of recruiting
      a new unit is somewhat counterintuitive; it is necessary to <A
      HREF="#form">FORM</A> an empty unit, <A HREF="#give">GIVE</A> the empty
      unit some money, and have it <A HREF="#buy">BUY</A> people; see the
      description of the <A HREF="#form">FORM</A> order for further details.

    <P>
      All items except silver, some magical items and monster drops are
      produced with the <A HREF="#produce">PRODUCE</A> order. Example: PRODUCE
      SWORDS will produce as many swords as possible during the month,
      provided that the unit has adequate supplies of iron and has the
      smithing skill. Required skills and raw materials are in the table
      above.
    </P>
    <P>
      If an item requires raw materials, then the specified amount of each
      material is consumed for each item produced. Thus to produce 5 longbows
      (a supply of arrows is assumed to be included with the bow), 5 units of
      yew are required. The higher ones skill, the more productive each
      man-month of work; thus, 5 longbows could be produced by a 5-man unit of
      skill 1, or a 1-man unit of skill 5. Production of food works slightly
      differently; each worker will only use one unit of material, but will
      produce a number of units of food equal to their skill level. Only Trade
      factions can issue <A HREF="#produce">PRODUCE</A> orders however,
      regardless of skill levels.
    </P>
    <P>
      Items which increase production may increase production of advanced
      items in addition to the basic items listed.  Some of them also increase
      production of other tools.  Read the skill descriptions for details on
      which tools aid which production when not noted above.
    </P>
    <P>
      If an item does not list a raw material it may be produced directly from
      the land. Each region generally has at least one item that can be
      produced there.  Shown on the description of a region is a list of the
      items that can be produced, and the amount of each that can be produced
      per month.  This amount depends on the region type. It also varies from
      region to region of the same type. If the units in a region attempt to
      produce more of a commodity than can be produced that month, then the
      amount available is distributed among the producers

      Villages, Towns, and Cities:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Some regions in Atlantis contain villages, towns, and cities.  Villages
      add to the wages, population, and tax income of the region they are in.
      Also, villages will have an additional market for grain, mushrooms,
      livestock, lizards and fish. As the village's demand for these goods is
      met, the population will increase. When the population reaches a certain
      theshold, the village will turn into a town.  A town will have some
      additional products that it demands, in addition to what it previously
      wanted.  Also a town will sell some new items as well. A town whose
      demands are being met will grow, and above another threshold it will
      become a full-blown city.  A city will have additional markets for
      common items, and will also have markets for less common, more expensive
      trade items.
    </P>
    <P>
      Trade items are bought and sold only by cities, and have no other
      practical uses.  However, the profit margins on these items are usually
      quite high. Buying of trade items in a region counts against a Trade
      faction's quota of regions in which it may undertake trade activity
      (note that buying and selling normal items does not, nor does selling of
      Trade items).

      Buildings and Trade Structures:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Construction of buildings and ships goes as follows: each unit of work
      on a building requires a unit of the required resource and a man-month
      of work by a character with the appropriate skill and level; higher
      skill levels allow work proceed faster still using one unit of the
      required resource per unit of work done). Again, only Trade factions can
      issue <A HREF="#build">BUILD</A> orders. Here is a table of the various
      building types:

    <P>
      Size is the number of people that the building can shelter. Cost is both
      the number of man-months of labor and the number of units of material
      required to complete the building.  There are possibly other buildings
      which can be built that require more advanced resources, or odd skills
      to construct.   The description of a skill will include any buildings
      which it allows to be built.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are other structures that increase the maximum production of
      certain items in regions; for example, a Mine will increase the amount
      of iron that is available to be mined in a region.  To construct these
      structures requires a high skill level in the production skill related
      to the item that the structure will help produce. This bonus in
      production is available to any unit in the region; there is no need to
      be inside the structure.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are two ways how this bonus is gotten.
    </P>
    <P>
      The first possibility is that the first structure built in a region will
      increase the maximum production of the related product by 25%; the
      amount added by each additional structure will be half of the the effect
      of the previous one.  (Note that if you build enough of the same type of
      structure in a region, the new structures may not add _any_ to the
      production level).
    </P>
    <P>
      The second possibility is that the first structure boosts the production
      of the related item by a fixed amount. The maount added by each
      additional structure will be half that amount.

    <P>
      Note that these structures will not increase the availability of an item
      in a region which does not already have that item available. Also, Trade
      structures do not offer defensive bonuses (which is why they do not have
      a size associated with them).  As with regular buildings, the Cost is
      the number of man-months of labor and also the number of units of raw
      material required to complete the structure. You can use two different
      materials (wood or stone) to construct most trade structures. It is
      possible that there are structures not listed above which require either
      advanced resources to build or which increase the production of advanced
      resources.  The skill description for a skill will always note if new
      structures may be built based on knowing that skill.

      Roads:
    </H3>
    <P>
      There is a another type of structure called roads.  They do not protect
      units, nor aid in the production of resources, but do aid movement, and
      can improve the economy of a hex.
    </P>
    <P>
      Roads are directional and are only considered to reach from one hexside
      to the center of the hex.  To gain a movement bonus, there must be two
      connecting roads, one in each adjacent hex.  Only one road may be built
      in each direction. If a road in the given direction is connected, units
      move along that road at half cost to a minimum of 1 movement point.
    </P>
    <P>
      For example: If a unit is moving northwest, then hex it is in must have
      a northwest road, and the hex it is moving into must have a southeast
      road.
    </P>
    <P>
      To gain an economy bonus, a hex must have roads that connect to roads in
      at least two adjoining hexes.  The economy bonus for the connected roads
      raises the wages in the region by 1 point.

      Building Decay:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Some structures will decay over time if they are not maintained.
      Difficult terrain and bad weather will speed up this decay. Maintnenance
      involves having units with the appropriate level of skill expend a small
      amount of the material used to build the structure and labor on a fairly
      regular basis in the exactly same manner as they would work on the
      building it if it was not completed. In other words, enter the structure
      and issue the BUILD command with no parameters. If a structure will need
      maintenance, that information will be related in the object information
      given about the structure. If a structure is allowed to decay, it will
      not give any of its bonuses until it is repaired.

      Ships are constructed similarly to buildings, except they tend to be
      constructed out of wood, not stone, and their construction tends to
      depend on the Shipbuilding skill, not the Building skill. Only faction
      with at least one faction point spent on trade can issue <A
      HREF="#build">BUILD</A> orders. Here is a table on the various ship
      types:

    <P>
      The capacity of a ship is the maximum weight that the ship may have
      aboard and still move. The cost is both the man-months of labor and the
      number of units of material required to complete the ship. The sailors
      are the number of skill levels of the Sailing skill that must be aboard
      the ship (and issuing the <A HREF="#sail">SAIL</A> order in order for
      the ship to sail).

    <A NAME="economy_advanceditems"></A>
    <H3>
      Advanced Items:
    </H3>
    <P>
      There are also certain advanced items that highly skilled units can
      produce. These are not available to starting players, but can be
      discovered through study.  When a unit is skilled enough to produce one
      of these items, he will receive a skill report describing the production
      of this item. Production of advanced items is generally done in a manner
      similar to the normal items.
    </P>
    <A NAME="economy_income"></A>
    <H3>
      Income:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Units can earn money with the <A HREF="#work">WORK</A> order.  This
      means that the unit spends the month performing manual work for wages.
      The amount to be earned from this is usually not very high, so it is
      generally a last resort to be used if one is running out of money. The
      current wages are shown in the region description for each region. All
      units may <A HREF="#work">WORK</A>, regardless of skillsor faction type.
    </P>
    <A NAME="economy_entertainment"></A>
    <H3>
      Entertainment:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Units with the Entertainment skill can use it to earn money.  A unit
      with Entertainment level 1 will earn 20 silver per man by issuing the <A
      HREF="#entertain">ENTERTAIN</A> order.  The total amount of money that
      can be earned this way is shown in the region descriptions.  Higher
      levels of Entertainment skill can earn more, so a character with
      Entertainment skill 2 can earn twice as much money as one with skill 1
      (and uses twice as much of the demand for entertainment in the region).
      Note that entertainment income is much less, per region, than the income
      available through working or taxing. All factions may have entertainers,
      regardless of faction type.
    </P>
    <A NAME="economy_taxingpillaging"></A>
    <H3>
      Taxing/Pillaging:
    </H3>
    <P>
      War factions may collect taxes in a region.  This is done using the <A
      HREF="#tax">TAX</A> order (which is not a full month order). The amount
      of tax money that can be collected each month in a region is shown in
      the region description. A unit may <A HREF="#tax">TAX</A> if it has
      Combat skill of at least level 1 or has a weapon and the appropriate
      skill to use it. Each taxing character can collect $50, though if the
      number of taxers would tax more than the available tax income, the tax
      income is split evenly among all taxers.
    </P>
    <P>
      War factions may also pillage a region. To do this requires the faction
      to have enough combat ready men in the region to tax half of the
      available money in the region. The total amount of money that can be
      pillaged will then be shared out between every combat ready unit that
      issues the <A HREF="#pillage">PILLAGE</A> order. The amount of money
      collected is equal to twice the available tax money. However, the
      economy of the region will be seriously damaged by pillaging, and will
      only slowly recover over time.  Note that <A HREF="#pillage">PILLAGE</A>
      comes before <A HREF="#tax">TAX</A>, so a unit performing <A
      HREF="#tax">TAX</A> will collect no money in that region that month.
    </P>
    <P>
      It is possible to safeguard one's tax income in regions one controls. 
      Units which have the Guard flag set (using the <A
      HREF="#guard">GUARD</A> order) will block <A HREF="#tax">TAX</A> orders
      issued by other factions in the same region, unless you have declared
      the faction in question Friendly. Units on guard will also block <A
      HREF="#pillage">PILLAGE</A> orders issued by other factions in the same
      region, regardless of your attitude towards the faction in question, and
      they will attempt to prevent Unfriendly units from entering the region. 
      Only units which are able to tax may be on guard.  Units on guard  are
      always visible regardless of Stealth skill, and will be marked as being
      "on guard" in the region description.

      Combat

    <P>
      Combat occurs when one unit attacks another.  The computer then gathers

      defending side, and the two sides fight until an outcome is reached.
    </P>
    <A NAME="com_attitudes"></A>
    <H3>
      Attitudes:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Which side a faction's units will fight on depends on declared
      attitudes.  A faction can have one of the following attitudes towards
      another faction:  Ally, Friendly, Neutral, Unfriendly or Hostile.  Each
      faction has a general attitude, called the "Default Attitude", that it
      normally takes towards other factions; this is initially Neutral, but
      can be changed.  It is also possible to <A HREF="#declare">DECLARE</A>
      attitudes to specific factions, e.g. <A HREF="#declare">DECLARE</A> 27
      ALLY will declare the Ally attitude to faction 27.  (Note that this does
      not necessarily mean that faction 27 has decided to treat you as an
      ally.)
    </P>
    <P>
      Ally means that you will fight to defend units of that faction whenever
      they come under attack, if you have non-avoiding units in the region
      where the attack occurs.  You will also attempt to prevent any theft or
      assassination attempts against units of the faction, if you are capable
      of seeing the unit which is attempting the crime. It also has the
      implications of the Friendly attitude.
    </P>
    <P>
      Friendly means that you will accept gifts from units of that faction. 
      This includes the giving of items, units of people, and the teaching of
      skills.  You will also admit units of that faction into buildings or
      ships owned by one of your units, and you will permit units of that
      faction to collect taxes (but not pillage) in regions where you have
      units on guard.
    </P>
    <P>
      Unfriendly means that you will not admit units of that faction into any
      region where you have units on guard.  You will not, however,
      automatically attack unfriendly units which are already present.
    </P>
    <P>
      Hostile means that any of your units which do not have the Avoid Combat
      flag set (using the <A HREF="#avoid">AVOID</A> order) will attack any
      units of that faction wherever they find them.
    </P>
    <P>
      If a unit can see another unit, but does not have high enough
      Observation skill to determine its faction, it will treat the unit using
      the faction's default attitude, even if the unit belongs to an
      Unfriendly or Hostile faction, because it does not know the unit's
      identity.  However, if your faction has declared an attitude of Friendly
      or Ally towards that unit's faction, the unit will be treated with the
      better attitude; it is assumed that the unit will produce proof of
      identity when relevant. (See the section on stealth for more information
      on when units can see each other.)
    </P>
    <P>
      If a faction declares Unfriendly or Hostile as default attitude (the
      latter is a good way to die fast), it will block or attack all
      unidentified units, unless they belong to factions for which a Friendly
      or Ally attitude has been specifically declared. Units which cannot be
      seen at all cannot be directly blocked or attacked, of course.
    </P>
    <A NAME="com_attacking"></A>
    <H3>
      Attacking:
    </H3>
    <P>
      A unit can attack another by issuing an <A HREF="#attack">ATTACK</A>
      order. A unit that does not have Avoid Combat set will automatically
      attack any Hostile units it identifies as such. When a unit issues the
      <A HREF="#attack">ATTACK</A> order, or otherwise decides to attack
      another unit, it must first be able to attack the unit. There are two
      conditions for this; the first is that the attacking unit must be able
      to see the unit that it wishes to attack.  More information is available
      on this in the stealth section of the rules.
    </P>
    <P>
      Secondly, the attacking unit must be able to catch the unit it wishes to
      attack.  A unit may only catch a unit if its effective Riding skill is
      greater than or equal to the target unit's effective Riding skill;
      otherwise, the target unit just rides away from the attacking unit. 
      Effective Riding is the unit's Riding skill, but with a potential
      maximum; if the unit can not ride, the effective Riding skill is 0; if
      the unit can ride, the maximum effective Riding is 3; if the unit can
      fly, the maximum effective Riding is 5. Note that the effective Riding
      also depends on whether the unit is attempting to attack or defend; for
      attack purposes, only one man in the unit needs to be able to ride or
      fly (generally, this means one of the men must possess a horse, or other
      form of transportation), whereas for defense purposes the entire unit
      needs to be able to ride or fly (usually meaning that every man in the
      unit must possess a horse or other form of speedier transportation).
      Also, note that for a unit to be able to use its defensive Riding
      ability to avoid attack, the unit cannot be in a building, ship, or
      structure of any type.
    </P>
    <P>
      A unit which is on guard, and is Unfriendly towards a unit, will deny
      access to units using the <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order to enter its
      region. Note that to deny access to a unit, at least one unit from the
      same faction as the unit guarding the hex must satisfy the above
      requirements. A unit using <A HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> instead of <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A> to enter a region, will attack any units that
      attempt to deny it access.  If the advancing unit loses the battle, it
      will be forced to retreat to the previous region it moved through.  If
      the unit wins the battle and its army doesn't lose any men, it is
      allowed to continue to move, provided that it has enough movement
      points.
    </P>
    <P>
      Note that these restrictions do not apply for sea combat, as units
      within a ship are always visible, and Riding does not play a part in
      combat on board ships.
    </P>
    <A NAME="com_muster"></A>
    <H3>
      The Muster:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Once the attack has been made, the sides are gathered.  Although the <A
      HREF="#attack">ATTACK</A> order takes a unit rather than a faction as
      its parameter (mainly so that unidentified units can be attacked), an
      attack is basically considered to be by an entire faction, against an
      entire faction and its allies.
    </P>
    <P>
      On the attacking side are all units of the attacking faction in the
      region where the fight is taking place, except those with Avoid Combat
      set.  A unit which has explicitly (or implicitly via <A
      HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A>) issued an <A HREF="#attack">ATTACK</A>
      order will join the fight anyway, regardless of whether Avoid Combat is
      set.
    </P>
    <P>
      Also on the attacking side are all units of other factions that attacked
      the target faction (implicitly or explicitly) in the region where the
      fight is taking place.  In other words, if several factions attack one,
      then all their armies join together to attack at the same time (even if
      they are enemies and will later fight each other).
    </P>
    <P>
      On the defending side are all identifiable units belonging to the
      defending faction.  If a unit has Avoid Combat set and it belongs to the
      target faction, it will be uninvolved only if its faction cannot be
      identified by the attacking faction.  A unit which was explicitly
      attacked will be involved anyway, regardless of Avoid Combat. (This
      means that Avoid Combat is mostly useful for high stealth scouts.) Also,
      all non-avoiding units located in the target region belonging to
      factions allied with the defending unit will join in on the defending
      side.
    </P>
    <P>
      Units in adjacent regions can also become involved.  This is the
      exception to the general rule that you cannot interact with units in a
      different region.
    </P>
    <P>
      If a faction has at least one unit involved in the initial region, then
      any units in adjacent regions will join the fight, if they could reach
      the region and do not have Avoid Combat set. There are a few flags that
      units may set to affect this; a unit with the Hold flag (set using the
      <A HREF="#hold">HOLD</A> order) will not join battles in adjacent
      regions.  This flag applies to both attacking and defending factions.  A
      unit with the Noaid flag (set using the <A HREF="#noaid">NOAID</A>
      order) will receive no aid from adjacent hexes when attacked, or when it
      issues an attack.
    </P>
    <P>
      Example:  A fight starts in region A, in the initial combat phase
      (before any movement has occurred).  The defender has a unit of soldiers
      in adjacent region B.  They have 2 movement points at this stage. They
      will buy horses later in the turn, so that when they execute their <A
      HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order they will have 4 movement points, but right
      now they have 2. Region A is forest, but fortunately it is summer, so
      the soldiers can join the fight.
    </P>
    <P>
      It is important to note that the units in nearby regions do not actually
      move to the region where the fighting happens; the computer only checks
      that they could move there.  (In game world terms, presumably they did
      move there to join the fight, and then moved back where they started.) 
      The computer checks for weight allowances and terrain types when
      determining whether a unit could reach the scene of the battle. Note
      that the use of ships is not allowed in this virtual movement.
    </P>
    <P>
      If you order an attack on an ally (either with the <A
      HREF="#attack">ATTACK</A> order, or if your ally has declared you
      Unfriendly, by attempting to <A HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> into a
      region which he is guarding), then your commander will decide that a
      mistake has occurred somewhere, and withdraw your troops from the
      fighting altogether.  Thus, your units will not attack that faction in
      that region. Note that you will always defend an ally against attack,
      even if it means that you fight against other factions that you are
      allied with.
    </P>
    <A NAME="com_thebattle"></A>
    <H3>
      The Battle:
    </H3>
    <P>
      The troops having lined up, the fight begins. The computer selects the
      best tactician from each side; that unit is regarded as the leader of
      its side.  If two or more units on one side have the same Tactics skill,
      then the one with the lower unit number is regarded as the leader of
      that side.  If one side's leader has a better Tactics skill than the
      other side's, then that side gets a free round of attacks.
    </P>
    <P>
      In each combat round, the combatants each get to attack once, in a
      random order. (In a free round of attacks, only one side's forces get to
      attack.) Each combatant will attempt to hit a randomly selected enemy.
      If he hits, and the target has no armor, then the target is
      automatically killed.  Armor may provide extra defense against otherwise
      successful attacks.
    </P>
    <P>
      The basic skill used in battle is the Combat skill; this is used for
      hand to hand fighting.  If one soldier tries to hit another using most
      weapons, there is a 50% chance that the attacker will get an opportunity
      for a lethal blow.  If the attacker does get that opportunity, then
      there is a contest between his combat skill (modified by weapon attack
      bonus) and the defender's combat skill (modified by weapon defense
      bonus). Some weapons may not allow combat skill to affect defense (e.g.
      bows), and others may allow different skills to be used on defense (or
      offense).
    </P>
    <P>
      If the skills are equal, then there is a 1:1 (i.e. 50%) chance that the
      attack will succeed.  If the attacker's skill is 1 higher then there is
      a 2:1 (i.e. 66%) chance, if the attacker's skill is 2 higher then there
      is a 4:1 (i.e. 80%) chance, 3 higher means an 8:1 (i.e. 88%) chance, and
      so on. Similarly if the defender's skill is 1 higher, then there is only
      a 1:2 (i.e. 33%) chance, etc.
    </P>
    <P>
      Possession of a sword confers a +2 bonus to Combat skill for attack and
      a +2 bonus for defense. Troops which are fighting hand-to-hand without
      specific weapons are assumed to be irregularly armed with makeshift
      weapons such as clubs, pitchforks, torches, etc. Possession of a horse,
      and Riding skill, also confers a bonus to effective Combat skill equal
      to the Riding skill level (up to a maximum of 3) provided that the
      terrain allows horses to be used in combat. Winged horse are better yet,
      but require more basic Riding skill to gain any advantage. Certain
      weapons may provide different attack and defense bonuses, or have
      additional attack bonuses against mounted opponents or other special
      characteristics. These bonuses will be listed in the item descriptions
      in the turn reports.
    </P>
    <P>
      Some melee weapons may be defined as Long or Short (this is relative to
      a normal weapon, e.g. the sword).  A soldier wielding a longer weapon
      than his opponent gets a +1 bonus to his attack skill.
    </P>
    <P>
      Ranged weapons are slightly different from melee weapons.  The target
      will generally not get any sort of combat bonus to defense against a
      ranged attack. The skill check to hit with a long bow is made against an
      effective defense of -2; i.e., a longbowman with a skill 1, having made
      the 50% chance of getting an effective attack, has a 1:2 chance of
      hitting a target. A crossbow is an easier weapon to use, so the chance
      to hit is calculated against a defense of -3; on the other hand, a
      crossbow can only fire once every 2 rounds, including the free round of
      attacks if ones side has one.
    </P>
    <P>
      Weapons may have one of several different attack types: Slashing,
      Piercing, Crushing, Cleaving and Armor Piercing.  Different types of
      armor may give different survival chances against a sucessful attack of
      different types.
    </P>
    <P>
      A soldier attacking with a ranged weapon will generally be treated as if
      they have a Combat skill of 0, even if they have an actual Combat skill.
       This is the trade off for being able to hit from the back line of
      fighting.
    </P>
    <P>
      Being inside a building confers a +2 bonus to defense.  This bonus is
      effective against ranged as well as melee weapons.  The number of men
      that a building can protect is equal to its size. The size of the
      various common buildings was listed in the <A
      HREF="#tablebuildings">Table of Buildings</A> earlier. 
    </P>
    <P>
      If there are too many units in a building to all gain protection from
      it, then those units who have been in the building longest will gain
      protection.  (Note that these units appear first on the turn report.) If
      a unit of 200 men is inside a Fort (capacity 50), then the first 50 men
      in the unit will gain the full +2 bonus, and the other 150 will gain no
      protection.
    </P>
    <P>
      Units which have the Behind flag set are at the rear and cannot be
      attacked by any means until all non-Behind units have been wiped out. 
      On the other hand, neither can they attack with melee weapons, but only
      with ranged weapons or magic.  Once all front-line units have been wiped
      out, then the Behind flag no longer has any effect.

      Combat rounds continue until one side has accrued 50% losses (or more).
      The victorious side is then awarded one free round of attacks, after
      which the battle is over.  If both sides have more than 50% losses, the
      battle is a draw, and neither side gets a free round.
    </P>
    <P>
      Units with the Healing skill have a chance of being able to heal
      casualties of the winning side, so that they recover rather than dying. 
      Each character with this skill can attempt to heal 5 casualties per
      skill level. Each attempt however requires one unit of Herbs, which is
      thereby used up. Each attempt has a 50% chance of healing one casualty;
      only one attempt at Healing may be made per casualty. Healing occurs
      automatically, after the battle is over, by any living healers on the
      winning side.
    </P>
    <P>
      Any items owned by dead combatants on the losing side have a 50% chance
      of being found and collected by the winning side. Each item which is
      recovered is picked up by one of the survivors able to carry it (see the
      <A HREF="#spoils">SPOILS</A> command) at random, so the winners
      generally collect loot in proportion to their number of surviving men.
    </P>
    <P>
      If you are expecting to fight an enemy who is carrying so much equipment
      that you would not be able to move after picking it up, and you want to
      move to another region later that month, it may be worth issuing some
      orders to drop items (with the <A HREF="#give">GIVE</A> 0 order) or to
      prevent yourself picking up spoils beyond your capacity (with the <A
      HREF="#spoils">SPOILS</A> order) in case you win the battle! Also, note
      that if the winning side took any losses in the battle, any units on

      Stealth and Observation
    </H2>
    <P>
      The Stealth skill is used to hide units, while the Observation skill is
      used to see units that would otherwise be hidden. A unit can be seen
      only if you have at least one unit in the same region, with an
      Observation skill at least as high as that unit's Stealth skill. If your
      Observation skill is equal to the unit's Stealth skill, you will see the
      unit, but not the name of the owning faction. If your Observation skill
      is higher than the unit's Stealth skill, you will also see the name of
      the faction that owns the unit.
    </P>
    <P>
      Regardless of Stealth skill, units are always visible when participating
      in combat; when guarding a region with the Guard flag; or when in a

      Stealing:

      The <A HREF="#steal">STEAL</A> order is a way to steal items from other
      factions without a battle.  The order can only be issued by a one-man
      unit. The order specifies a target unit; the thief will then attempt to
      steal the specified item from the target unit.
    </P>
    <P>
      If the thief has higher Stealth than any of the target faction's units
      have Observation (i.e. the thief cannot be seen by the target faction),
      the theft will succeed. The target faction will be told what was stolen,
      but not by whom.  If the specified item is silver, then $200 or half the
      total available, whichever is less, will be stolen.  If it is any other
      item, then only one will be stolen (if available).
    </P>
    <P>
      Any unit with high enough Observation to see the thief will see the

      Assassination:
    </H3>
    <P>
      The <A HREF="#assassinate">ASSASSINATE</A> order is a way to kill
      another person without attacking and going through an entire battle.
      This order can only be issued by a one-man unit, and specifies a target
      unit.  If the target unit contains more than one person, then one will
      be singled out at random.
    </P>
    <P>
      Success for assassination is determined as for theft, i.e. the assassin
      will fail if any of the target faction's units can see him.  In this
      case, the assassin will flee, and the target faction will be informed
      which unit made the attempt.  As with theft, allies of the target unit
      will prevent the assassination from succeeding, if their Observation
      level is high enough.
    </P>
    <P>
      If the assassin has higher stealth than any of the target faction's
      units have Observation, then a one-on-one fight will take place between
      the assassin and the target character.  The assassin automatically gets
      a free round of attacks, except he is limited to 3 total during the free
      round; after that, the battle is handled like a normal fight, with the
      exception that neither assassin nor victim can use any armor except
      cloth armor. Most armor is forbidden for the assassin because it would
      make it too hard to sneak around, and for the victim because he was
      caught by surprise with his armor off. If the assassin wins, the target
      faction is told merely that the victim was assassinated, but not by
      whom.  If the victim wins, then the target faction learns which unit
      made the attempt.  (Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the
      assassin's faction is known.)  The winner of the fight gets 50% of the

      determined by the faction's type. Any attempt to gain more, either
      through study, or by transfer from another faction, will fail.  In
      addition, mages may not <A HREF="#give">GIVE</A> men at all; once a unit
      becomes a mage (by studying one of the Foundations), the unit number is
      fixed. (The mage may be given to another faction using the <A
      HREF="#give">GIVE</A> UNIT order.)

      Magic Skills:
    </H3>
    <P>
      Magic skills are the same as normal skills, with a few differences.  The
      basic magic skills, called Foundations, are force, pattern, and spirit.
      To become a mage, a unit undertakes study in one of these Foundations. 
      As a unit studies the Foundations, he will be able to study deeper into
      the magical arts; the additional skills that he may study will be
      indicated on your turn report.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are two major differences between Magic skills and most normal
      skills. The first is that the ability to study Magic skills sometimes
      depends on lower level Magic skills.  The Magic skills that a mage may
      study are listed on his turn report, so he knows which areas he may
      pursue.  Studying higher in the Foundation skills, and certain other
      Magic skills, will make other skills available to the mage. Also, study
      into a magic skill above level 2 requires that the mage be located in
      some sort of building which can offer specific protection to mages. 
      Certain types of buildings can offer shelter and support and a proper
      environment, some more so than others. If the mage is not in such a
      structure, his study rate is cut in half, as he does not have the proper
      environment and equipment for research.

                  A mage may use his magical power in three different ways,
                  depending on the type of spell he wants to use.  Some
                  spells, once learned, take effect automatically and are
                  considered always to be in use; these spells do not require
                  any order to take effect.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Secondly, some spells are for use in combat. A mage may
                  specify that he wishes to use a spell in combat by issuing
                  the <A HREF="#combat">COMBAT</A> order.  A combat spell
                  specified in this way will only be used if the mage finds
                  himself taking part in a battle.
                </P>
                <P>
                  The third type of spell use is for spells that take an
                  entire month to cast.  These spells are cast by the mage
                  issuing the <A HREF="#cast">CAST</A> order. Because <A
                  HREF="#cast">CAST</A> takes an entire month, a mage may use
                  only one of this type of spell each turn. Note, however,
                  that a <A HREF="#cast">CAST</A> order is not a full month
                  order; a mage may still <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A>, <A
                  HREF="#study">STUDY</A>, or use any other month long order.
                  The justification for this (as well as being for game
                  balance) is that a spell drains a mage of his magic power
                  for the month, but does not actually take the entire month
                  to cast.
                </P>
                <P>
                  The description that a mage receives when he first learns a
                  spell specifies the manner in which the spell is used
                  (automatic, in combat, or by casting).

                <P>
                  NOTE: This section is rather vague, and quite advanced.  You
                  may want to wait until you have figured out other parts of
                  Atlantis before trying to understand exactly all of the
                  rules in this section.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Although the magic skills and spells are unspecified in
                  these rules, left for the players to discover, the rules for
                  combat spells' interaction are spelled out here.  There are
                  five major types of attacks, and defenses: Combat, Ranged,
                  Energy, Weather, and Spirit.  Every attack and defense has a
                  type, and only the appropriate defense is effective against
                  an attack.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Defensive spells are cast at the beginning of each round of
                  combat, and will have a type of attack they deflect, and
                  skill level (Defensive spells are generally called Shields).
                   Every time an attack is launched against an army, it must
                  first attack the highest level Shield of the same type as
                  the attack, before it may attack a soldier directly. Note
                  that an attack only has to attack the highest Shield, any
                  other Shields of the same type are ignored for that attack.
                </P>
                <P>
                  An attack spell (and any other type of attack) also has an
                  attack type, and attack level, and a number of blows it
                  deals. When the attack spell is cast, it is matched up
                  against the most powerful defensive spell of the appropriate
                  type that the other army has cast.  If the other army has
                  not cast any applicable defensive spells, the attack goes
                  through unmolested.  Unlike normal combat however, men are
                  at a disadvantage to defending against spells.   Men which
                  are in the open (not protected by a building) have an
                  effective skill of -2 unless they have a shield or some
                  other defensive magic.  Some monsters have bonuses to
                  resisting some attacks but are more susceptible to others.
                  The skill level of the attack spell and the effective skill
                  for defense are matched against each other.  The formula for
                  determining the victor between a defensive and offensive
                  spell is the same as for a contest of soldiers; if the
                  levels are equal, there is a 1:1 chance of success, and so
                  on.  If the offensive spell is victorious, the offensive
                  spell deals its blows to the defending army, and the Shield
                  in question is destroyed (thus, it can be useful to have
                  more than one of the same type of Shield in effect, as the
                  other Shield will take the place of the destroyed one). 
                  Otherwise, the attack spell disperses, and the defending
                  spell remains in place.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Some spells do not actually kill enemies, but rather have
                  some negative effect on them. These spells are treated the
                  same as normal spells; if there is a Shield of the same type
                  as them, they must attack the Shield before attacking the
                  army. Physical attacks that go through a defensive spell
                  also must match their skill level against that of the
                  defensive spell in question.  However, they do not destroy
                  the defensive spell when they are successful.

                  All cities and towns begin with guardsmen in them.  These

                  town, and will also prevent theft and assassination
                  attempts, if their Observation level is high enough. They
                  are on guard, and will prevent other units from taxing or
                  pillaging. The guards may be killed by players, although
                  they will form again if the city is left unguarded.

                  Through various methods, you may gain control of certain
                  types of monsters. These monsters are just another item in a
                  unit's inventory, with a few special rules. Monsters will be
                  able to carry things at their speed of movement; use the <A
                  HREF="#show">SHOW</A> ITEM order to determine the carrying
                  capacity and movement speed of a monster. Monsters will also
                  fight for the controlling unit in combat; their strength can
                  only be determined in battle. Also, note that a monster will
                  always fight from the front rank, even if the controlling
                  unit has the behind flag set. Whether or not you are allowed
                  to give a monster to other units depends on the type of
                  monster; some may be given freely, while others must remain

                <P>
                  Each type of order is designated by giving a keyword as the
                  first non-blank item on a line.  Parameters are given after
                  this, separated by spaces or tabs. Blank lines are
                  permitted, as are comments; anything after a semicolon is
                  treated as a comment (provided the semicolon is not in the
                  middle of a word).
                </P>
                <P>
                  The parser is not case sensitive, so all commands may be
                  given in upper case, lower case or a mixture of the two. 
                  However, when supplying names containing spaces, the name
                  must be surrounded by double quotes, or else underscore
                  characters must be used in place of spaces in the name. 
                  (These things apply to the #ATLANTIS and #END lines as well
                  as to order lines.)

                  You may precede orders with the at sign (@), in which case
                  they will appear in the Template at the bottom of your
                  report.  This is useful for orders which your units repeat
                  for several months in a row.

                </H3>
                <P>
                  All common items and skills have abbreviations that can be
                  used when giving orders, for brevity.  Any time you see the
                  item on your report, it will be followed by the
                  abbreviation.  Please be careful using these, as they can
                  easily be confused.

                <P>
                  To specify a [unit], use the unit number.  If specifying a
                  unit that will be created this turn, use the form "NEW #" if
                  the unit belongs to your faction, or "FACTION # NEW #" if
                  the unit belongs to a different faction.  See the <A
                  HREF="#form">FORM</A> order for a more complete description.
                   [faction] means that a faction number is required; [object]
                  means that an object number (generally the number of a
                  building or ship) is required. [item] means an item (like
                  wood or longbow) that a unit can have in its possession.
                  [flag] is an argument taken by several orders, that sets or
                  unsets a flag for a unit. A [flag] value must be either 1
                  (set the flag) or 0 (unset the flag).  Other parameters are
                  generally numbers or names.
                </P>
                <P>
                  IMPORTANT: Remember that names containing spaces (e.g.,
                  "Plate Armor"), must be surrounded by double quotes, or the
                  spaces must be replaced with underscores "_" (e.g.,
                  Plate_Armor).
                </P>
                <P>
                  Also remember that anything used in an example is just that,
                  an example and makes no gaurentee that such an item,
                  structure, or skill actually exists within the game.

                  as it can. If the demand for the item (from all units in the

                  Attempt to change your faction's type.  In the order, you
                  can specify up to three faction types (WAR, TRADE, and
                  MAGIC) and the number of faction points to assign to each
                  type; if you are assigning points to only one or two types,
                  you may omit the types that will not have any points.

                <P>
                  Changing the number of faction points assigned to MAGIC may
                  be tricky. Increasing the MAGIC points will always succeed,
                  but if you decrease the number of points assigned to MAGIC,
                  you must make sure that you have only the number of
                  magic-skilled leaders allowed by the new number of MAGIC
                  points BEFORE you change your point distribution. For
                  example, if you have 3 mages (3 points assigned to MAGIC),
                  but want to use one of those points for WAR or TRADE (change
                  to MAGIC 2), you must first get rid of one of your mages by
                  either giving it to another faction or ordering it to <A
                  HREF="#forget">FORGET</A> all its magic skills. If you have
                  too many mages for the number of points you try to assign to
                  MAGIC, the FACTION order will fail.

                  Form a new unit.  The newly created unit will be in your
                  faction, in the same region as the unit which formed it, and
                  in the same structure if any.  It will start off, however,
                  with no people or items; you should, in the same month,
                  issue orders to transfer people into the new unit, or have
                  it recruit members. The new unit will inherit its flags from
                  the unit that forms it, such as avoiding, behind, and
                  autotax.

                <P>
                  The purpose of the "alias" parameter is so that you can
                  refer to the new unit. You will not know the new unit's
                  number until you receive the next turn report.  To refer to
                  the new unit in this set of orders, pick an alias number
                  (the only restriction on this is that it must be at least 1,
                  and you should not create two units in the same region in
                  the same month, with the same alias numbers).  The new unit
                  can then be referred to as NEW <alias> in place of the
                  regular unit number.
                </P>
                <P>
                  You can refer to newly created units belonging to other
                  factions, if you know what alias number they are, e.g.
                  FACTION 15 NEW 2 will refer to faction 15's newly created
                  unit with alias 2.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Note: If a unit moves out of the region in which it was
                  formed (by the <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order, or
                  otherwise), the alias will no longer work. This is to
                  prevent conflicts with other units that may have the same
                  alias in other regions.
                </P>

                  If the demand for recruits in that region that month is much
                  higher than the supply, it may happen that the new unit does
                  not gain all the recruits you ordered it to buy, or it may
                  not gain any recruits at all.  If the new units gains at
                  least one recruit, the unit will form possessing any unused
                  silver and all the other items it was given.  If no recruits
                  are gained at all, the empty unit will be dissolved, and the
                  silver and any other items it was given will revert to the
                  first unit you have in that region.

                  This set of orders for unit 17 would create two new units
                  with alias numbers 1 and 2, name them Merlin's Guards and
                  Merlin's Workers, set the description for Merlin's Workers,
                  have both units recruit men, and have Merlin's Guards study
                  combat.  Merlin's Workers will have the default order <A
                  HREF="#work">WORK</A>, as all newly created units do. The
                  unit that created these two then pays them enough money
                  (using the NEW keyword to refer to them by alias numbers) to
                  cover the costs of recruitment and the month's maintenance.

                  regions the unit is not in.  This can be useful if the unit
                  is in a building, and doesn't want to leave the building to
                  join combat. HOLD 0 cancels holding status.

                  Note that MOVE orders can lead to combat, due to hostile
                  units meeting, or due to an advancing unit being forbidden
                  access to a region.  In this case, combat occurs each time
                  all movement out of a single region occurs.

                  Example 1: Units 1 and 2 are in Region A, and unit 3 is in
                  Region B.  Units 1 and 2 are hostile to unit 3.  Both unit 1
                  and 2 move into region B, and attack unit 3.  Since both
                  units moved out of the same region, they attack unit 3 at
                  the same time, and the battle is between units 1 and 2, and
                  unit 3.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Example 2: Same as example 1, except unit 2 is in Region C,
                  instead of region A.  Both units move into Region B, and
                  attack unit 3.  Since unit 1 and unit 2 moved out of
                  different regions, their battles occur at different times. 
                  Thus, unit 1 attacks unit 3 first, and then unit 2 attacks
                  unit 3 (assuming unit 3 survives the first attack).  Note
                  that the order of battles could have happened either way.

                  In order to rename a settlement (city, town or village), the
                  unit attempting to rename it must be the owner of a large
                  enough structure located in the city. It requires a tower or
                  better to rename a village, a fort or better to rename a
                  town and a castle or mystic fortress to rename a city. It
                  also costs $10 to rename a village, $20 to rename a town,
                  and $30 to rename a city.

                  NOAID 1 indicates that if the unit attacks, or is attacked,

                  The PASSWORD order is used to set your faction's password.
                  If you have a password set, you must specify it on your
                  #ATLANTIS line for the game to accept your orders.  This
                  protects you orders from being overwritten, either by
                  accident or intentionally by other players.  PASSWORD with
                  no password given clears out your faction's password.
                </P>
                <P>
                  IMPORTANT: The PASSWORD order does not take effect until the
                  turn is actually run.  So if you set your password, and then
                  want to re-submit orders, you should use the old password
                  until the turn has been run.

                  The SPOILS order allows you to limit the spoils you should
                  take after a battle.  The valid values for type are 'NONE',
                  'WALK', 'RIDE', 'FLY', or 'ALL'. The second form is
                  equivalent to 'SPOILS ALL'.

                <P>
                  When level NONE is specified, only spoils with 0 weight will
                  be picked up. SPOILS ALL will allow a unit to collect any
                  spoils which are dropped regardless of weight or capacity.
                  SPOILS follwed by a movement mode will allow a unit to
                  collect any spoils while the spoils don't prevent the unit
                  to move using the specified movement mode.

                  The most important sections of the turn report are the
                  "Events During Turn" section which lists what happened last
                  month, and the "Current Status" section which gives the
                  description of each region in which you have units.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Your units in the Current Status section are flagged with a
                  "*" character. Units belonging to other factions are flagged
                  with a "-" character. You may be informed which faction they
                  belong to, if you have high enough Observation skill or they
                  are revealing that information.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Objects are flagged with a "+" character.  The units listed
                  under an object (if any) are inside the object.  The first
                  unit listed under an object is its owner.
                </P>
                <P>
                  If you can see a unit, you can see any large items it is
                  carrying.  This means all items other than silver, herbs,
                  and other small items (which are of zero size units, and are
                  small enough to be easily concealed). Items carried by your
                  own units of course will always be listed.

                <P>
                  At the bottom of your turn report is an Orders Template. 
                  This template gives you a formatted orders form, with all of
                  your units listed. You may use this to fill in your orders,
                  or write them on your own. The <A HREF="#option">OPTION</A>
                  order gives you the option of giving more or less
                  information in this template, or turning it of altogether.
                  You can precede orders with an '@' sign in your orders, in
                  which case they will appear in your template on the next
                  turn's report.

                  Always have a month's supply of spare cash in every region
                  in which you have units, so that even if they are deprived
                  of income for a month (due to a mistake in your orders, for
                  example), they will not starve to death.  It is very
                  frustrating to have half your faction wiped out because you
                  neglected to provide enough money for them to live on.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Be conservative with your money. Leaders especially are very
                  hard to maintain, as they cannot usually earn enough by <A
                  HREF="#work">WORK</A>ing to pay their maintenance fee. Even
                  once you have recruited men, notice that it is expensive for
                  them to <A HREF="#study">STUDY</A> (and become productive
                  units), so be sure to save money to that end.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Don't leave it until the last minute to send orders.  If
                  there is a delay in the mailer, your orders will not arrive
                  on time, and turns will NOT be rerun, nor will it be
                  possible to change the data file for the benefit of players
                  whose orders weren't there by the deadline.  If you are
                  going to send your orders at the last minute, send a
                  preliminary set earlier in the week so that at worst your
                  faction will not be left with no orders at all.
